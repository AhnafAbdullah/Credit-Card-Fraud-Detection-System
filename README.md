This project focuses on building a Fraud Detection Model that uses Machine Learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions.
Various Machine Learning Algorithms are used and their results compared visually.
The techniques used include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosted Tree Method (from XGBoost).
